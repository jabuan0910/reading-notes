# JavaScript

### Day 6 - 6/25/22 - Code 102

We have learned JavaScript today in relation to variables and what the content of the code looks like. In a nutshell, its a dynamic language that gives interaction for a website that are coded with certain expressions and variables. Its like having interactive muscles for both html and css in order to move. Additionally, we learned its similar to Python and it can store data variables. Consistently, there is a quite a bit of logic that's put into it.

Reading Assignment: Start with variables. Look at the content and code. Get familiar and read through documentation for 30 minutes.

## What is JavaScript?
JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

## There are some key features in detail that includes features of JavaScript to make the language work, such as variables, strings, numbers and arrays.


# Variables

### What are they?

Variables are containers for storing data or storing data values. They are expressions that hold values like in algebra.

There are 4 ways to Declare a JavaScript variable:
* var
* let
* const
* nothing

Examples:  
  > var x = 5;
  > var y = 6;
  > var z = x + y;

  * x, y and z are variables, declared as **var** keyword.

Examples: 
  >let x = 5;
  >let y = 6;
  >let z = x + y;

  * x, y, and z are variable declared as **let** keyword.


Examples:
  > x = 5;
  > y = 6;
  > y = x + y;

  * x, y, and z are undeclared variables.

In order to use **const** and how to use it?
  >As a general rule, it can always declare **variables** as *const*.
  >If the variable can change, then use **let**.

Examples:
  >const price1 = 5;
  >const price2 = 6;
  >let total = price1 + price2;

  * As the two variables *price1* and *price2* are declared with const keyword. These values cannot be changed.
  * As the variable **total** is declared with the **let** keyword. This value can be changed.

All javascript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names would be called *identifiers*.
> Examples of identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

General rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:
  * Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
  * Names must begin with a letter
  * Names can also begin with $ and_
  * Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
  * Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names

> **Note**: JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.

# Data Types

* Numbers
* Strings
* Booleans
* NaN
* Undefined
