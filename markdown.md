# Hello, my name is *James*. 

## Welcome to my page. I am an new to coding and my instructor had just assigned this task to practice Markdown on GitHub. I've never used GitHub before. So far, I think its cool. After this I'm excited to learn command line. 

As we have discussed initially about **Growth Mindset**. There are two sides to having a type of mindset. Either you have a fixed mindset or you have a growth mindset. For me, I choose growth mindset. There are certain powers to having such greatness in this style of intelligence. In a nutshell, growth mindset allows you to learn and grow both personally and professionally without being capped or being heldback from some sort of external negativitiy. 

> #### Three reminders on how I should keep myself in a growth mindset:
> 
> - Realize anytime there is an avoidance to a problem, that I should recognize its truly as it is and see what I can do to approach it from another perspective. So, don't give up!
> - When facing a challenge, realizing that it would be to easy to diverge my attention from something else like checking email or socil media with knowing that it wouldn't be a viable option. In recognizing to what may steer myself away would put me in a fixed mindset. 
> - Telling myself, "No pain, no gain!" and making the effort out of greatness instead of leaving it to the side for later.
